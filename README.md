# PyTorch Machine Reading Comprehension Toolkit
## Introduction
**The PyTorch Machine Reading Comprehension (PyTorch-MRC)** toolkit, which was rewritten on the basis of Sogou Machine Reading Comprehension (SMRC), was designed for the fast and efficient development of modern machine comprehension models, including both published models and original prototypes.
