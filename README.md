# PyTorch Machine Reading Comprehension Toolkit
## Introduction
**The PyTorch Machine Reading Comprehension (PyTorch-MRC)** toolkit, which was rewritten on the basis of Sogou Machine Reading Comprehension (SMRC), was designed for the fast and efficient development of modern machine comprehension models, including both published models and original prototypes.

## Toolkit Architecture

## Installation

## Quick Start

## Modules
1. `data`
2. `dataset`
3. `examples`
4. `model`
5. `nn`
6. `utils`
7. `libraries`

## Custom Model and Dataset

## Performance

### F1/EM score on SQuAD 1.1 dev set

### F1/EM score on SQuAD 2.0 dev set

### F1 score on CoQA dev set

## Additional information
When implementing the MRC model, **sometimes I didn't follow the paper reproduction model completely**, because some parts of the paper were not clear to me or I didn't think they play a decisive role. So here's a description. Next I'll list the changes I've made.
